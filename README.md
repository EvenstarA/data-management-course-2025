# data-management-course-2025
This repository is for the Honour's Data Management Course, 2025. 

The contents of this repository include a data set of pitfall trap contents, specifically ant species, species counts, and quadrat data based on soil surface features (i.e. bare ground, leaf litter etc.). Basic data anaylses and visualisations are performed in the R-scriot (data_analyses.R), and the raw data is available in both .xlsx and .txt froms, as well as a link to a Google Sheet. 

In addition, my thought process and analyses are documented in a readable and shareable format, found in quarto_writeup.qmd.
